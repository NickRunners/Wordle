# Wordle 🕹️


## Rules 📜
The game goal is to guess a secret word of 10 characters in within 12 attempts. The secret word changes every 8 hours. <br />
If all attempts are exhausted or if one exits the game without having guessed correctly, the system records a defeat on the player's account. Whether in the case of victory or defeat, one must wait for the change of the secret word to start a new game.

## How to play 🔧
To play, it is necessary to execute JAR files. First, ensure that _Server.jar_ is running, then execute _Client.jar_ to start the game. Both files have 'localhost' as the IP address by default, but you can run them on different machines after changing the IP address in the _.properties_ files.

## Code and documentation 📑
More details and explanations about implementation choices can be found in _nc_wordle.pdf_. The code comments and documentation are in Italian because this project was made by me as a university project.
