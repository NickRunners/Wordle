# Wordle 🕹️


## Rules 📜
The game goal is to guess a secret word of 10 characters in within 12 attempts. The secret word changes every 8 hours. <br />
If all attempts are exhausted or if one exits the game without having guessed correctly, the system records a defeat on the player's account. Whether in the case of victory or defeat, one must wait for the change of the secret word to start a new game.

## How to play 🔧
To play is necessary to exec JAR files. First of all make sure that _Server.jar_ is running, then exec _Client.jar_ for the game itself. Both have localhost as IP address, but they can run in different machines after changing it in _.properties_ files.

## Code and documentation 📑
More details and explanations about implementative choices are in _nc_wordle.pdf_, code comments and documentation are in italian because this was made by me as an university project.
